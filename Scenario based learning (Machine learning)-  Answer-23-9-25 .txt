Scenario Based Learning
A company works with number of employees, all the works are dependents on the employees. Even
if one of the employees resign the job immediately then assigned work will be not finished at the
time, so delivery of the project to the clients will be delayed. Company planned to make solution for
this, they want to know which employee may resign next. If they know previously, they can arrange
alternative to avoid such problem. As an AI Engineer you must give Solution to this.
A) How will you achieve this in AI?
B) Find out the 3 -Stage of Problem Identification
C) Name the project
D) Create the dummy Dataset.






A) Based of employees mode of interest in his job, and his salary is acceptable to that employees, this we previously predict that


B) Machine learning  -  stage 1


      Supervised Learing - stage 2


      classification (categorical value) interested or not interested


C) Employees mode of interest - Name of the project


D)  sl.no. --   employee name -- department-- -------salary-- ----mode of interest
